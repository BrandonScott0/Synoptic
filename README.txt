#Synoptic Project (MAZE GAME)

Olde Worlde Phunne develops computer games for a variety of platforms,
specialising in games that hark back to the past.
The company wishes to increase traffic to its website by offering a simple maze
game free of charge. The first version of this maze game is built as a chrome extension
with the option to expand to other browsers such as firefox, Edge and safari if this first
version is as the customer wanted.

saved to and select ok. After this is done a small icon should be added to the toolbar, select
